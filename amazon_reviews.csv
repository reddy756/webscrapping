4.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall, the performance of the MacBook Air M1 is excellent. However, the storage capacity might feel limited for some users. To enhance the experience, I recommend purchasing an external SSD after getting the MacBook Air M1. This will provide additional storage space for files and applications, ensuring smooth performance without running out of space."

Soothing.My first order for the same product was automatically returned back to the seller. It was a good incident as the serial number of the MacBook pertaining to that order was already in use. The warranty of that product started 5 days before the order was placed for the same. Hence it’s a caution ⚠️ —- Do check your warranty using the serial no of the product before you accept the product. It might happen that everything is packed and sealed but the product which you’re receiving is already a returned product or a used one. Beware of this. Just make sure you check the warranty using the serial number that it’s not yet started while you’re receiving it and you are good to go. This time my product is genuine hence sharing the video. This is my second macbook. My first MacBook Pro m1 13 inch had an auto shutdown issue after 3 years of usage fixing which was costlier than getting this hence I ordered this. I hope it goes well. Hopefully this will last long . 🤞"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently purchased the mac, and overall, it has been an excellent addition to my tech arsenal. The performance is stellar, handling multitasking and demanding applications with ease. The design is sleek and modern, making it a joy to use both at home and on the go.However, there’s one notable issue: I occasionally experience a mild shock when charging. While this has not been a dealbreaker for me, it is concerning and something potential buyers should be aware of. I recommend using a grounded outlet or checking the charging equipment to mitigate this problem.In summary, the mac delivers impressive performance and design, but the charging issue is something to consider. If you’re looking for a reliable laptop, this one is still worth a look!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have been in expensive apple ecosystem for more than 10 years and never ever had the opportunity of affordable “New Mac” at this price point , with apple warranty of one year after 4 years of this product release(2020) !!If you are a student or a professional using laptop for day to day tasks and for lite photo and video editing , this is the perfect machine and this would also support Apple intelligence .BTW , the delivery agent was courteous for open box recording and received the product as expected , I was little skeptical ordering online for big money with fraudulence being so often , however seems things are safe to order online nowadays , however have to be careful though !"
